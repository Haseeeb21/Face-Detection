# Face-Detection
Face Detection, Face + Blurring, Face + Eye Detection, and Saving. Using haarcascade xml files.


### Other xml files

There are also other Haarcascade Frontalface files such as,

- haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml
- haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml

I have used default one here, you can try different files and select which suites best. 

According to my research / experiments default file gave better results. However, depening on the use case and camera do try different xml and see which results suite you the most.
