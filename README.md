# Face-Detection
Face Detection, Face + Blurring, Face + Eye Detection, and Saving. Using haarcascade xml files.


## Other xml files

There are also other Haarcascade Frontalface files such as,

- haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml
- haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml

I have used default one here, you can try different files and select which suites best. Difference is that they use different data structures.

According to my research / experiments default file gave better results. However, depening on the use case and camera do try different xml and see which results suite you the most.

You can explore and see there are also other files which can detect `Full Body`, `Lower Body`, `Upper Body`, `Smile`, etc.
